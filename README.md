Rust code that integrates Redis and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure token management in web applications. 
It provides functionality for creating, signing, and validating JWTs while leveraging Redis as a storage backend for token information. 
This combination allows developers to efficiently manage user authentication and authorization with enhanced security and performance in Rust applications.
